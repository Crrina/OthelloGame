# OthelloGame
OthelloGame in Java that uses multithreading and sockets. You need to start the server first, which is the file ServerStart from the folder src/ss/othello/networking/server  and enter a port number. After that you need to start at least 2 instances of the class OthelloTui in the folder src/ss/othello/ui and enter the portnumber and server adress (localhost if it is on the same machine) to be able to play a game. Note there is another class called OthelloTui in src/ss/othello/game/localTUI if you want to play the game locally without using sockets and connecting to server.
